    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/uploads/herve.png" width="140" height="140" title="Place Kitten #3" > Bootstrapped companies can't afford to wait around to reach a network effect. You need to start generating dollars as early as possible so that you can quit your day job or put a stop to the draining of your bank account as soon as possible. Bootstrapping startups don't have the luxury to wait around. So when generating an idea for your startup, toss out everything that doesn't involve charging a fee for at least some of your clients. Leave the ad revenue and crazy business model revenue streams to the startups with venture funding. That's just not your game to play.</p>
